After that, the game will display the board and ask you to enter your move. 

You can enter your move by typing the row and column number of the cell you want to mark, separated by a space. For example, 1 2 means the first row and the second column.

The game will then update the board. The game will continue until either one of the players wins or the board is full. 

The game will then display the final score and ask you if you want to play again.
